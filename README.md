# Use My Tools Marketing Page

This is the landing/marketing page for the Use My Tools web application which was built during Lambda School Build Week

## Deployment

[https://use-my-tools-build-week.github.io/marketing-page](https://use-my-tools-build-week.github.io/marketing-page)

## Local Installation

To build this site locally, the less preprocessor needs to be installed globally. If you have the [Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed, you can run:

`yarn global add less`

Once `less` is installed an this repo is forked or cloned to your machine, run:

`less-watch-compiler less css index.less`

This will watch the entire `less` folder for changes and output the `index.css` file in the `css` directory.
